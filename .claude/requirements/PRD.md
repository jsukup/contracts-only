## Document Metadata
- **Project Name:** ContractsOnly
- **Version:** 1.0.0
- **Date Created:** 2025-08-15
- **Last Updated:** 2025-08-15

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Purpose
ContractsOnly is a specialized job board platform designed exclusively for short-term contract positions with hourly rates. Unlike traditional job boards that cater to full-time employment, ContractsOnly focuses on connecting skilled contractors with companies and staffing agencies seeking temporary talent. The platform provides transparency in hourly rates, contract terms, and builds trust through mutual ratings between contractors and employers. Inspired by 4dayweek.io's clean interface and user experience, ContractsOnly will differentiate itself by addressing the specific needs of the contract labor market.

### 1.2 Vision Statement
To become the premier marketplace where contractors and companies efficiently connect for transparent, short-term engagements that benefit both parties through clear expectations and mutual accountability.

### 1.3 Success Criteria
- [ ] 1,000 active job postings within 6 months
- [ ] 10,000 contractor profiles within 6 months
- [ ] 4.5+ average platform rating from users
- [ ] 50,000 monthly job applications (click-throughs)
- [ ] Comprehensive analytics report by September 2025 showing market demand
- [ ] Successful monetization launch October 2025 with data-driven pricing

---

## 2. Problem Statement & Business Case

### 2.1 Problem Definition
The current job market lacks a dedicated platform for contract-only positions where contractors and companies can easily find each other with transparent hourly rates and terms. Existing platforms either focus on full-time positions or have complex fee structures that obscure true costs. Contractors struggle to find legitimate short-term opportunities while companies need a reliable source of pre-vetted temporary talent without long-term commitments.

### 2.2 Current State Analysis
- General job boards (Indeed, LinkedIn) mix contract and full-time roles, making filtering difficult
- Freelance platforms (Upwork, Fiverr) focus on project-based work, not hourly contracts
- Staffing agencies have limited online presence and opaque rate structures
- No platform specializes in short-term, hourly-rate contract positions
- Lack of transparency in rates and contract terms creates friction

### 2.3 Business Value
- **Market Research Phase:** Free platform until September 2025 to gather user data and feedback
- **Data-Driven Monetization:** Analytics-informed pricing strategy starting October 2025
- **Market Efficiency:** Reduces time-to-hire from 2-3 weeks to 3-5 days
- **Cost Transparency:** Clear hourly rates reduce negotiation overhead
- **Quality Assurance:** Rating system improves match quality over time

### 2.4 Alternatives Considered
1. **Do Nothing:** Market remains fragmented, opportunity cost of $500K+ annually
2. **Partner with Existing Platform:** Less control, revenue sharing, feature limitations
3. **Build Full-Stack Talent Marketplace:** Higher complexity, longer time to market, diluted focus
