    "description": "Since 2007, Accena SWPPP Services has partnered with construction contractors, developers, and excavators delivering expert Stormwater Pollution Prevention.\n\nOurs is a small niche where the EPA and Utah require construction sites to be inspected on a bi\\-weekly basis and after .25\" of rain to verify the mitigations and controls to prevent dirt, mud, and debris from running off the site are installed and still functioning as intended.\n\nYou must be responsible, dependable, and able to perform your duties with little supervision. You also need your own reliable vehicle and a clean driving record. You will be paid as a 1099 independent contractor.\n\nWe provide training and what is needed to complete the inspections.\n\nThe current inspection site is located at:\n\n2\\. East Side of Bear Lake: 41\u00b059'13\\.5\"N 111\u00b015'51\\.5\"W\n\nEach inspection typically takes less than 30 minutes. After the inspection, a short electronic report will need to be sent to our office with your findings.\n\nTo qualify, you will need to complete the free EPA online 8\\-hour course for stormwater inspectors within a week of being hired. We will provide additional personal training and will walk you through the first inspection (s).\n\nWe will pay **$120 for taking and passing the course** and then **$100 per inspection (twice per month including your gas and time) plus $75 for extra drive\\-by inspections after .25\" of rain** (you will be notified by email when the rain reaches .25\"). You are responsible for your vehicle and gas.\n\nWe are hiring immediately.\n\n*FYI: Anytime someone seeks an application for development or construction, there are EPA and Utah regulatory requirements to ensure appropriate measures are in place, such as a silt fence and storm drain covers, to make sure dirt and other pollutants aren\u2019t entering storm drains and then directly into our rivers.*\n\n*Before construction starts, builders and developers are required to make sure there is a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) in place to prevent stormwater pollution. Our team develops SWPPPs for our clients.*\n\n*The No. 1 cause of stormwater pollution is sediment that is carried into streams, rivers, and lakes along with other pollutants which can kill fish and other aquatic life and cause the growth of harmful algae.*\n\n*During the active construction process, the site must be inspected at least twice per month and after rain events to verify the stormwater controls are performing as intended.*\n\nJob Type: Contract\n\nPay: $200\\.00 \\- $275\\.00 per month\n\nApplication Question(s):\n\n* Do you have access to a vehicle to drive to and from the inspection site?\n* The law requires that the inspections must take place at 14 day intervals. Can you inspect the site on the same day of the week, every two weeks?\n* Do you recognize this is a short\\-term \"gig\" job? Please do not apply if you are looking for a full or part\\-time job.\n\nWork Location: On the road",
